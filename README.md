# OgarV

Your friendly agar.io private server recreation.

- It supports all current agar.io protocol versions (4 - 20).

- It supports handling multiple worlds, all within one instance. Be wary that you can still use up the one CPU core node.js is running on.

- It has a minimal memory footprint, and strictly uses uWebSockets for networking.

- The code uses JSDoc to specify types. Understanding what the code does is down to your understanding of English.

## Notes

- Ask all your questions over on the [Agar.io Private Servers](https://discord.gg/66X2ESb) Discord guild.

- Before connecting from agar.io you will need to do `core.disableIntegrityChecks(true)` in the console.

## Running

1. Make sure you have node.js version 8 or greater.

2. Make sure you have a C++11 compliant compiler for building uWebSockets.

    - If you're on Windows, `npm install -g windows-build-tools`.
    - If you're on GNU/Linux, use your package manager to install a supported C++ compiler such as GCC.

3. Clone / [download](https://github.com/Yukidaruma-dev/OgarV/releases/download/1.3.0/OgarV_v1.3.0.zip) the repo.

4. `npm install` in `/`.

5. `cd ./cli/`

6. `node index.js`

## Configuring

- After your first run, OgarV will drop two files in `cli/` / working directory: `log-settings.json` and `settings.json`.

- To change how OgarV runs, modify `cli/settings.json`.

- To change what gets logged, modify `cli/log-settings.json`.

## Expanding

- To create your own commands, check out `src/commands/CommandList.js` on the command API. To add it to the CLI use `ServerHandle.commands.register`, and for chat commands use `ServerHandle.chatCommands.register`.

- To create your own gamemodes, inherit `src/Gamemode.js`'s `Gamemode` abstract class, modify event handling to your wish, then add it with `ServerHandle.gamemodes.register` before the handle starts.

- The `ServerHandle` class is standalone, which means that you can completely ditch the `cli/` folder, `require("./src/ServerHandle.js")` and do whatever you want with it.
